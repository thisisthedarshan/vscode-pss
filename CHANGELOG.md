- Fixed highlighting grammar and updated logic to highlight nested function calls and template items.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-04-14

- Added highlighting for custom action names (user defined actions with _a in them)
- **Finally** Added server to git repo - was missing from previous releases ðŸ˜…
- Added markdown highlighting for PSS code in markdown!
- The parser structure is changed from the server with more enhancements such as hierarchial ast building, capturing of user-defined data types, assignments, etc.
